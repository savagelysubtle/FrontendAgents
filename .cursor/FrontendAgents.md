# AI Agent Lab Refactoring Progress

## Phase 1: UI/UX Refinements

### Step 1.1: Enhance Theme Toggle Logic (✅ Completed)
*   **Objective:** Provide a more intuitive and potentially direct theme toggling experience.
*   **Key Files Modified:**
    *   `ai-agent-lab/hooks/useTheme.ts`: Updated to return `[themePreference, effectiveTheme, setTheme]`. `effectiveTheme` is always 'light' or 'dark'.
    *   `ai-agent-lab/components/Header.tsx`: Updated `toggleTheme`, `getThemeIcon`, and `getThemeTooltip` to use `effectiveTheme` for a direct light/dark toggle.
    *   `ai-agent-lab/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`: Updated to use `themePreference` from the modified `useTheme` hook, ensuring it correctly displays and sets the stored theme preference ('light', 'dark', 'system').
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    *   The theme hook now clearly distinguishes between the stored preference and the effective visual theme.
    *   The header toggle directly switches between light and dark modes.
    *   The settings page continues to allow users to set 'light', 'dark', or 'system' as their preference.
*   **Verification:**
    *   Theme toggle in header directly switches between light and dark.
    *   Icon and tooltip on toggle button reflect the action correctly.
    *   Settings page allows selection of 'Light', 'Dark', or 'System'. Header toggle overrides 'System' choice to 'Light' or 'Dark'.

### Step 1.2: Improve Chat Message Styling for System Messages (✅ Completed)
*   **Objective:** Make system messages in the chat interface more visually distinct.
*   **Key Files Modified:**
    *   `ai-agent-lab/components/ChatMessage.tsx`: Modified the rendering of system messages to use a more prominent and distinct styling (background, border, rounded-lg, italic text).
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    *   System messages now have a unique appearance (e.g., `bg-[var(--card-background)] dark:bg-zinc-800/60 border border-[var(--border-secondary)] rounded-lg px-3 py-1.5 shadow-sm`) to differentiate them from user and assistant messages.
    *   The text within system messages is now italicized.
*   **Verification:**
    *   System messages in the chat (e.g., "Chat history cleared by user.") have a clearly distinct visual appearance.
    *   The new styling is theme-aware and adapts to light/dark mode.

## Phase 2: Service Layer Enhancements for Agent Communication

### Step 2.1: Refactor `mcpClientService.ts` for Extensibility (✅ Completed)
*   **Objective:** Modify `mcpClientService.ts` for easier adaptation to different communication protocols.
*   **Key Files Modified:**
    *   `ai-agent-lab/services/mcpClientService.ts`:
        *   Defined `IAgentConnection` interface with methods like `initialize`, `listTools`, `callTool`, `close`, `getIsConnected`, `getServerReportedCapabilities`, etc.
        *   `MockMcpClient` class now implements `IAgentConnection`.
        *   `activeClients` map updated to `Map<string, IAgentConnection>`.
        *   `mcpClientService.getClient` return type changed to `IAgentConnection | undefined`.
        *   Service methods updated to use `IAgentConnection` interface methods (e.g., `getIsConnected`).
*   **Summary of Changes:**
    *   Introduced an `IAgentConnection` interface to abstract client implementations.
    *   Refactored `MockMcpClient` to implement this interface.
    *   Updated internal typings and method calls within `mcpClientService` to use the interface, promoting extensibility.
    *   The external API of `mcpClientService` remains unchanged to avoid breaking UI components.
*   **Verification:**
    *   The `ai-agent-lab` application (specifically areas using `mcpClientService`, like `ToolsPage.tsx`) should continue to function as before with the mock MCP tools.
    *   The internal structure of `mcpClientService.ts` is more modular, allowing for easier addition of new client types in the future.
